# Bad-Weather-Notifier
This is an application that allows you to create schedules to notify yourself about bad weather. You can set your own time to receive messages about weather forecasts. This way, you'll always be informed about potential precipitations in advance. The app uses weather APIs to provide accurate and reliable forecasts. You can customize the notification settings to suit your preferences, such as choosing between push notifications or email alerts. Server tools are Python and Flask, SQl for user database. For fronted I used React and TailwindCSS. The clean and intuitive interface makes it easy to manage your schedules and stay on top of the weather. With this application, you'll never have to worry about unexpected weather ruining your plans again.
